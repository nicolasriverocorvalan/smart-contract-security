# Exercise 5

And now, we tie it all together! Will this transaction execute? Sign if you think so... Otherwise reject it. This is the same transaction from a previous one Except this time, we are executing it.

Assume your wallet address is 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266, and you are a signer on a valid mutlisig wallet at address 0x4087d2046A7435911fC26DCFac1c2Db26957Ab72 using safe version 1.4.1. You are attempting to deposit 0.1 ETH to the ZKsync Aave token pool.

Please execute this transaction if you think it will not revert based on the calldata, and if it will do what we think it should.
